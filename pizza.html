    <h2>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yeast</strong><br>
             Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong><br>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar.<br>
             The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> activation process</a>. <br>
             You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top. </li><br>
        <li><strong>Bread Flour</strong><br><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bread flour</a> is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier results than all-purpose flour.<br>
             This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. <br>Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong><br> serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color <br>
             and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong><br>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust),<br>
             and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. <br>It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:</p>
    
    <h4>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h4>
    <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. <br>This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</p>
  
    <h4>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h4>  
    <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. <br>
       This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. <br>
       Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. <br>
       This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</p> 
    
    <h4>SHape the Dough</h4>
    <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air,<br>
       use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose,<br>
       make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture.<br>
       When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide<br>
       and about â…“-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</p>
